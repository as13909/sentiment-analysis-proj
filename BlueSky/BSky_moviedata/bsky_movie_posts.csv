Mulan,0,2020-09-07T08:09:03Z,Disney clearly didn’t want to make a straight comedy—this is a war movie action/drama—so lean into it.

F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:35Z,12) Better Luck Tomorrow - An early Justin Lin film that spawned the character Han (a fave!) Not pertinent to plot at all. Skippable (but a fun heist movie!) #f9 #TheFastSaga,0.3333
F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:34Z,11) Fast & Furious Spy Racers (a spin off TV show) - even I haven't seen this. Totally skippable. #f9 #TheFastSaga,0.1
F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:33Z,10) The short films (Turbo Charged and Los Bandeleros) - skippable #f9 #TheFastSaga,0.0
F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:32Z,9) Hobbs & Shaw - It's unclear how much the spin off plots will influence the main series but A) I suspect it will have significant influece and B) it's just a delightful romp. Watch it if you have time wiki if you don't. #f9 #TheFastSaga,0.4354
F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:30Z,7) Furious 7 - yes yes yes yes yes yes yes(watch it!)This is maybe the best of the franchise? It's just so artfully bonkers. This is where the series truly found the door to asking you to not just suspend your disbelief but disregard it entirely & you're happy to do so! #F9,0.6667
F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:29Z,"6) Fast & Furious 6 - Now we're cooking with gas. This begins a story arc you'll want to follow from the beginning & the flavors are all here. Watch it.

F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:28Z,5) Five Five - the ingredients are starting to come together. The Rock joins the cast and we start to see the intentional disregard for logic and physics that elevate the later movies into art. You can skip it if you're crunched for time but it's REALLY FUN. #f9 #TheFastSaga,0.1
F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:27Z,4) Fast & Furious - a reunion of the original cast. This one hooked me back into the franchise after starting to lose interest after 2F2F and Tokyo Drift but ultimately it's a little dull. Skippable #f9 #TheFastSaga,0.016
F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:26Z,3) The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. An attempt to create a structural sequel without any of the existing characters. Skip it & read the Wiki. While released 3rd the events of this movie were retconned to occur in between the conclusion of 6's main plot & its epilogue #f9,0.1222
F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:25Z,2) 2 Fast 2 Furious - The first sequel. Skip it and read the wiki entry. There are recurring characters that originate here but the whole thing just doesn't have the FF magic. (though it does have the best sequel name of all time) #f9 #TheFastSaga,0.43
F9,0,2021-06-22T19:48:24Z,1) The Fast and the Furious - The OG. Some will tell you this is skippable b/c it's just your standard heist movie w/o the absolute shenanigans that skyrocketed the franchise into orbit. To them I would say: #TheFastSaga is about FAMILY and the family starts HERE. Watch it. #F9,0.1333

Encanto,0,2021-11-28T07:54:42.000Z,ENCANTO is a breathtakingly beautiful film full of awe-inspiring design and animation. One of those rare movies that you can just disappear into.,0.5
Encanto,0,2021-11-27T03:57:54.000Z,Encanto is absolutely adorable. Notably I don't think there's a single character in it that I didn't like by the end? Also it's nice that it's a relatively small story with no real villain to speak of.,0.1964

Top Gun: Maverick,0,2022-06-05T05:33:45Z,So as much as I enjoyed Top Gun: Maverick I also see it as a perfect fantasy of a movie because god I wish we were as graceful and dignified as the movie. That we're not and can't seem to get there is such a problem. I wonder if it's too late to learn a lesson7/7,0.34
Top Gun: Maverick,0,2022-06-05T05:33:43Z,But it's wishful thinking because everything about the dignified way that Top Gun: Maverick handled itself is the opposite of how this country is handling itself now. Our refusal to age with dignity is leading us to embrace the fecklessness of enticing political fantasies5/7,0.1667
Top Gun: Maverick,0,2022-06-05T05:33:42Z,It handles the fact that Maverick and Top Gun is a soon-to-be relic (but not yet so we can get one last mission in) before the drone guys change warfare forever.

Top Gun: Maverick,0,2022-06-05T05:33:40Z,If Top Gun: Original was a perfect for its time military propaganda piece full of wishful thinking about Cold War American exceptionalism as we saw it then Top Gun: Maverick is perfect for our time wishful thinking about American dignity and our country aging gracefully2/7,0.2659

Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,0,2022-05-02T21:55:22.000Z,Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore was quite uneven. It had a very strong closing 45 minutes but got bogged down in the middle part. Easily could've been edited down to 2 hours and been a better movie for it. For the record I quite liked the Crimes of Grindelwald.,0.1786

Elvis,1,2022-07-04T03:53:14Z,Elvis is a good subject for Baz Luhrmann's ADHD style filmmaking yet I appreciate those moments where he slows things down to humanize The King. Could have used more time on the rise than the fall- but that's Hollywood for you. Also I couldn't forget that Priscilla was 14. 14!,0.2507
Elvis,0,2022-07-03T23:33:45Z,Like if the muppets never happened would there be lots of guys named Kermit? If Elvis was named Frank would Frank be an unheard of name today?It seems arbitrary too: Adolf is obvious but yet Josef and Benito are safe. Jesus is a no-no yet Joshua (the Hebrew version) is fine,0.2042

Elvis,0,2022-06-28T11:02:28Z,So this new Elvis movie... I don't want to review it and I likely won't.

Way to misread the room Baz Luhrmann.,0.0242

Elvis,0,2022-06-26T17:37:22Z,I’ve honestly never cared that much about Elvis & biopics are far from my favourite thing but I had fun with #Elvis.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie,0,2023-04-07T22:26:06Z,3. The Super Mario Bros Movie (2023)I liked it. It’s an incredibly simple story but I think that fits Mario perfectly. It’s stuffed full of references from the visuals to the fantastic OST. I recommend every Mario fan at least check it out.,0.3405

Venom: The Last Dance,2,2024-10-24T21:56:09.527Z,*Spoiler free review* for Venom: The Last DanceThis entire trilogy is no masterpiece but I think this movie does everything it needs to do and it leans into the dumb fun aspect of the symbiotes.
